# Redlist Info

This simple react project allows users to search for species and gather information from the IUCN Red List. Given a species on the Red List, it provides threats, population trend and conservation status. Users can search for global and regional assessments.

## Why make this?
I built this as a personal project to learn more about Express and Node. The project uses an Express back end (hosted on a separate repository) to query species names from https://www.gbif.org/ to provide suggestions, before passing a selected species and region to the IUCN Red List API for assessment data.

Although this project started out as a way to learn Express, I also took the opportunity to learn Material-UI, a React framework for creating UIs using Material Design principles.
